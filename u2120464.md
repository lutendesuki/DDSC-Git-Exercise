# # Green Lantern

Starting us off we have a superhero with a lifetime JLA membership. The Lantern is yet another DC superhero to be inhabited by several characters, the most popular of which is that of Hal Jordan, who is an agent of an interstellar law enforcement agency known as the Green Lantern Corps.. Handed an alien power ring and the lantern to power it, he is one of many intergalactic guardians that fight with pure willpower manifested into physical form. While the first Green Lantern, Alan Scott, made his appearance way back in 1940â€™s All-American Comics #16, Hal arrived on the scene in 1959.
