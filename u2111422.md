Half man, half tree, Aion wanders through the jungles of the Rune Lands, and everywhere he passes he is alive and well. He knows the secrets of nature and is a friend to all, beasts, fish and insects alike. On his journeys, Aion teaches strange wisdom to those he meets, or cultivates a rich jungle. From time to time, he would also confide secrets he knew to butterflies whose mouths were not so tight.

Back in the long-ago days of Fredroyd, Aion was a brave warrior with an iron heart, even going by the nickname "Aion the Merciless". But with the rise of the Iceborn, the hapless Aion and his brethren were seen by them as mere hapless mortals who sought to challenge them. To overthrow the Warlocks, Aion and his cronies concocted a plan to overthrow them. With his battle-hardened men, he set sail from the Frostguard's frozen harbour to the fabled land where all magic originates. If Aion could master that kind of power, subversion of the Iceborn was just around the corner. As the fleet crossed the arc of the horizon, it disappeared to the edge of memory, falling into the mythology of the Clansmen. No one ever saw them again, and there is no trace of them in the local histories of Freelander, fading away like a path in the snow.

The sea had no regard for their noble mission and played with their ships with abandon. The waves came in like a bloodbath, scattering the last vestiges of the warriors' determination. Aion's sword, stained with the blood of many mutinous soldiers, finally accompanied his fleet to the shores of Ionia, followed by a merciless slaughter of the inhabitants. The Aeolians surrendered and led the Freelds to a sacred forest called Omicayaran, which means "heart of the world". Many of Aion's men saw this as a gift to their conquerors, a proof of submission. But it was in those strange turquoise gardens that they met with the fiercest retaliation.
